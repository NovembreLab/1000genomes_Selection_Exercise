# Understanding Natural Selection from Population Genomic Data

* still in progress (not tested). 
* using EDAR as an example (http://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs3827760)
* description / writing needs to be filled in 
* try to find the clearest possible example at first and then give fuzzy ones
* Add PBS and iHS references
* For line about check # of individuals is correct - give directives as to what is right answer
* Use environmental variables like $REGION = xx.  so that it easier to recycle code when they switch regions? 

To get some exposure to different approaches for detecting recent positive selection from population genetic data, we will be using the 1000 Genomes data.  We will present two approaches for detecting recent positive selection.  The first is an approach based on differentiation between populations, that uses the PBS (population-branch statistic) to detect selection that occurred in the history of a particular population.  The second is an approach based on haplotype patterns - using the iHS statistic. 

We will interact with the 1000 Genomes data using `vcf` (variant call format) files.  These files have one line per variant, and contain information about each individual's genotype as columns. These files are so large they are most often kept in a `gzip` compressed format, which you will recognize usually by seeing a filename that ends with `.vcf.gz`.  

Before anything, we need to set up a unix-based analysis environment with the appropriate programs:

* `tabix`: For quickly retrieving specific lines from a `.vcf.gz` file.  It creates an index of a `.vcf.gz` file and then uses the index to quickly find the lines a user requests.
* `bcftools`: For manipulating `vcf` files.  Here we use it for some basic filtering.
* `plink2` / `plink-1.9`: Second-generation of the multi-faceted `plink` tool.  It facilitates a number of common analyses in statistical genetics and population genetics.  Here we use it to compute $F_{ST}$ which we will need to compute the PBS statistic.  We assume you will run it using the command `plink-1.9`. 
* `selscan`: For computing haplotype-based statistics that are sensitive to signatures of selective sweeps (EHH, iHS, XP-EHH, nSL, for example)
* `norm`: A program from the `selscan` package that will normalize iHS or XP-EHH values. 

We have included an appendix, titled "Setting up your environment" that contains the appropriate instructions for installing these.  For the moment, we assume you have gone through this, or are using an account on a server that has been pre-configured for you, and so we will jump right into some analysis.  To be sure, check and see if the list of programs above can be found in a 'bin/' subdirectory of the main project directory here. 

As a disclaimer, in what follows - we take an approach that builds intuition and take some shortcuts to make analyses feasible in a classroom setting.  For publishable results, more rigor to assess the statistical significance of results is necessary than what we show here.  

### Preparing files that describe the 1000 Genomes individuals 

To get started, we will want some basic information on the individuals in the 1000 Genomes data.  We also want to simplify our analysis by just focusing on individuals from the CHB (Han Chinese from Beijing), YRI (Yoruba from Ibaden, Nigerai), and FIN (Finnish from Finland).  Let's get started... 

#### Downloading Individual-Level Data [SSS 2015 read-only, data already in data/]

We can download info on the 1000 Genomes phase III individuals with the following commands.  The `integrated_call_samples_v3.20130502.ALL.panel` file we are obtaining contains the sample id and associated population and gender info for each individual. 

```bash
cd data/

# download 1000genomes_phase3 individual information
wget ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/integrated_call_samples_v3.20130502.ALL.panel
```
Click [here](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/README.populations) for a for explanation of the population codes.

#### Setting up `.clst.txt` and `.iids` files for plink and bcftools analyses

In order to extract individuals and define groups for computing selection statistics within we need to prepare a set of `.clst.txt` and and `.iids` files.  You will inspect each file after they are created to see the basic structure of these files (e.g. using the `head` command to see the start of the file and `tail` to see the end of the file). 

The `.iids` files just contain a list of the individual ids we will include in our analysis.  

The `.clst.txt` files define a "cluster" of individuals to consider as a single unit for analysis (e.g, a cluster might represent a population). Here we create a such file for each pair of populations we will be analyzing. 

Here we use `awk` commands - `awk` is very useful unix-based tool for basic file manipulation. 

```bash
# use awk to produce a file that has the format of a .clst.txt file, with IID | IID | CLST for CHB, YRI, FIN
awk 'NR>1($2 == "CHB" || $2 == "YRI" || $2 == "FIN") {print $1, $1, $2}' integrated_call_samples_v3.20130502.ALL.panel > chb_yri_fin_clst.txt

# write a file with just the IIDs 
awk '{print $1}' chb_yri_fin_clst.txt > chb_yri_fin_iids.txt

# write a clst file for just CHB and YRI 
awk '($3 == "CHB" || $3 == "YRI") {print $0}' chb_yri_fin_clst.txt > chb_yri_clst.txt

# write a clst file for just CHB and FIN
awk '($3 == "CHB" || $3 == "FIN") {print $0}' chb_yri_fin_clst.txt > chb_fin_clst.txt

# write a clst file for just YRI and FIN
awk  '($3 == "YRI" || $3 == "FIN") {print $0}' chb_yri_fin_clst.txt > yri_fin_clst.txt

# check if # individuals are correct
wc -l chb_yri_fin_iids.txt chb_yri_clst.txt chb_fin_clst.txt yri_fin_clst.txt

# Visually inspect the top and botom of the files. 
head chb_yri_fin_iids.txt
tail chb_yri_fin_iids.txt

head chb_yri_clst.txt
tail chb_fin_clst.txt
```

### Downloading data for a specific 3Mb genomic region [SSS 2015 read-only, data already in data/]

Now, let's download a 3Mb part of the the 1000 Genomes Phase3 project data to use. 

```bash
cd data/

# download a 3MB region (chr2:108013601-111013601) from the 1000genomes project and store as .vcf.gz file
tabix -h ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/ALL.chr2.phase3_shapeit2_mvncall_integrated_v5a.20130502.genotypes.vcf.gz 2:108013601-111013601 | bgzip -c > 1000genomes_phase3_chr2_108013601_111013601.vcf.gz
```

We will use our list of individual ids from the YRI, FIN, and CHB to extract just those individuals from the larger 1000 genomes data.  We also want to filter out indels and multi-allelic sites. 

```bash
# keep only snps (-V indels), bi-allelic sites (-m 2 -M 2), individuals (-S) from YRI, FIN, CHB.
# this will be used for cross-population based selection analysis
bcftools view -v snps \
         -m 2 -M 2 \
         -S chb_yri_fin_iids.txt \
         -O z \
         1000genomes_phase3_chr2_108013601_111013601.vcf.gz > chb_yri_fin_chr2_108013601_111013601_filtered.vcf.gz
```

## Population-differentation-based selection scan

One approach to detecting recent positive selection is to see if a local genomic region shows extensive differentiation between *two* populations (using a population differentiation statistic such as $F_{ST}$ or a more formal inferential methods like [BayesScan](http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/BayeScan/) not shown here).  Let's do this for the CHB vs FIN comparison for our focal region.

### Computing pairwise $F_{ST}$s

```bash
# Fst between CHB and FIN
plink-1.9 --vcf chb_yri_fin_chr2_108013601_111013601_filtered.vcf.gz \
          --fst \
          --within chb_fin_clst.txt \
          --double-id \
          --id-delim . \
          --out chb_fin_chr2_108013601_111013601_filtered \
          --set-missing-var-ids @:#
```             


#### Visualizing pairwise $F_{ST}$ values

In another terminal window or screen open an R session that we will be using for the rest of the workshop. Now run these commands in the R session.  Make sure your working directory in R is set to the data subdirectory.  (Use the "Session" tab or setwd() command to change your working directory, e.g. setwd("~/git/1000genomes_Selection_Exercise/data")).

```R
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)

# read data
fst_chb_fin_df <- read.table('chb_fin_chr2_108013601_111013601_filtered.fst', header = TRUE) %>% 
                  rename(FST_CF = FST) %>% 
                  filter(is.nan(FST_CF) == FALSE) %>% 
                  select(SNP, POS, FST_CF)

# Prepare the plot
p <- ggplot(fst_chb_fin_df, aes(x = POS, y = FST_CF)) + geom_point() + xlab('Position on chr2') + 
     theme_bw() + ylab("") 

# View the plot
p

```

#### Questions

1.  Suppose the 99.9th percentile of $F_{ST}$ between CHB and FIN genome-wide is 0.5.  Do you see any variants in this 3Mb region that are among the most differentiated in the genome?  
2.  Can you assess from this data whether selection took place just in CHB, FIN, or both? 


### PBS

A drawback of such an approach is we do not know which of the two populations (or if both) have experienced selection causing the allele frequencies to differentiate.  Using *three* populations, we can compute a statistic that isolates a single populations. Specifically we compute an estimate of how much differentiation occured on the branch leading to a particular popualtion in a three-population tree consiting of a focal population, a sister population, and an outgroup population.  These `PBS` statistics are based on $F_{ST}$, so we start by computing pairwise $F_{ST}$ values. 

```bash
# Fst between CHB and YRI
plink-1.9 --vcf chb_yri_fin_chr2_108013601_111013601_filtered.vcf.gz \
          --fst \
          --within chb_yri_clst.txt \
          --double-id \
          --id-delim . \
          --out chb_yri_chr2_108013601_111013601_filtered \
          --set-missing-var-ids @:#
          
          
# Fst between YRI and FIN
plink-1.9 --vcf chb_yri_fin_chr2_108013601_111013601_filtered.vcf.gz \
          --fst \
          --within yri_fin_clst.txt \
          --double-id \
          --id-delim . \
          --out yri_fin_chr2_108013601_111013601_filtered \
          --set-missing-var-ids @:#
```

Let's now compute the PBS statistic for the FIN and the CHB to see if we can determine which population the selection occurred in. 

$$ T = -log(1 - Fst) $$
$$ PBS_{CHB} = \frac{T_{CY} + T_{CF} - T_{YF}}{2} $$
$$ PBS_{FIN} = \frac{T_{FY} + T_{FC} - T_{YC}}{2} $$

```R
fst_chb_yri_df <- read.table('chb_yri_chr2_108013601_111013601_filtered.fst', header = TRUE) %>% 
                  rename(FST_CY = FST) %>% 
                  filter(is.nan(FST_CY) == FALSE) %>% 
                  select(SNP, POS, FST_CY) 
              
fst_yri_fin_df <- read.table('yri_fin_chr2_108013601_111013601_filtered.fst', header = TRUE) %>% 
                  rename(FST_YF = FST) %>% 
                  filter(is.nan(FST_YF) == FALSE) %>% 
                  select(SNP, POS, FST_YF) 

# join fst data frames and compute pbs                
pbs_df <- fst_chb_fin_df %>%
          inner_join(fst_chb_yri_df, by = c("SNP", "POS")) %>%
          inner_join(fst_yri_fin_df, by = c("SNP", "POS")) %>%
          mutate(T_CY = -log(1 - FST_CY), T_CF = -log(1 - FST_CF), T_YF = -log(1 - FST_YF)) %>%
          mutate(PBS_CHB = (T_CY + T_CF - T_YF) / 2) %>%
          mutate(PBS_FIN = (T_CF + T_YF - T_CY) / 2) %>%
          select(POS, PBS_CHB, PBS_FIN)

# melt data for faceting in ggplot
melted_pbs_df <- melt(pbs_df, id = c("POS"))
  
# plot!        
p <- ggplot(melted_pbs_df, aes(x = POS, y = value)) + geom_point() + xlab('Position on chr2') + 
     theme_bw() + ylab("") + facet_grid(variable ~ .)
p
```

#### Questions

1. Explain the difference or lack of difference you see between the PBS computed for CHB and Finlad?
2. Draw the 3 population tree of (CHB, FIN, YRI) and mark which branch is extended. 

## iHS


Now's let turn towards looking at haplotype-based signatures of selection.  We'll focus on the CHB for this analysis. 

```bash

# write a file of just IIDs from CHB 
awk '($3 == "CHB") {print $1}' chb_yri_fin_clst.txt > chb_iids.txt

# keep CHB individuals from the filtered vcf and filter out rare variants (at maf < 5%)
# this will be used for haplotype based selection analysis.
bcftools view -S chb_iids.txt \
         -q '.05 minor' \
         -O z \
         chb_yri_fin_chr2_108013601_111013601_filtered.vcf.gz > \
         chb_chr2_108013601_111013601_filtered.vcf.gz

# write bim file from vcf (-H supress header)
bcftools view chb_chr2_135108646_138108646_filtered.vcf.gz -H | \
awk '{print $1, $3, "0", $2, $4, $5}' > chr2_108013601_111013601_filtered.bim


# get genetic positions and interpolate genetic positions for variants not present in the genetic_map
plink-1.9 --bim chr2_108013601_111013601_filtered.bim \
          --cm-map genetic_map_chr2_combined_b37.txt 2 \
          --make-just-bim \
          --out chr2_108013601_111013601_filtered_gm
          
# format as map file
awk '{print $1, $2, $3, $4}' chr2_108013601_111013601_filtered_gm.bim > chr2_108013601_111013601_filtered_gm.map
```


```bash
# compute iHS! This will take about 5 minutes 
selscan --ihs \
        --vcf chb_chr2_108013601_111013601_filtered.vcf.gz \
        --map chr2_108013601_111013601_filtered_gm.map \
        --out chb_chr2_108013601_111013601_filtered   
```

Normalize values

## Another Region 

Adapt the code you just ran using but now use this region (2:108013601-111013601) in the 1000genomes project. Instead of computing iHS for CHB compute it for FIN.

Ideally feed them script that takes chr, start, stop and produces plots generated above --
