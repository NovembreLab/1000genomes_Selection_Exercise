# SSW_2015

A workshop on detecting positive selection for Sardinia summer school workshop 2015.  The workshop introduces PBS and iHS approaches.  

It is still in development and the outstanding issues are:
* Polarizing vcf's to derived/ancestral
* Normalizing iHS on region-specific files is not sensible
* The extension to other examples could be made more elaborate
* Provide whole genome genetic map so one can analyze any region desired using code
* Add vlines for location of EDAR
* Plots at the bottom
* Answer key
