# Workshop: 1000 Genomes Selection Exercise

A workshop on detecting positive selection.  The workshop introduces PBS and iHS approaches.  

It usable and instructive as is, but it is still in development. 

The outstanding issues are:
* Polarizing vcf's to derived/ancestral
* Normalizing iHS on region-specific files is not ideal 
* The extension to other examples could be made more elaborate
* Provide whole genome genetic map so one can analyze any region desired using code
* Add vlines for location of EDAR
* Plots at the bottom
* Answer key
